# MXNet

[![MXNet](http://pkg.julialang.org/badges/MXNet_0.6.svg)](http://pkg.julialang.org/?pkg=MXNet)


MXNet.jl is the [Apache MXNet](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet) [Julia](http://julialang.org/) package. MXNet.jl brings flexible and efficient GPU computing and state-of-art deep learning to Julia. Some highlight of its features include:

* Efficient tensor/matrix computation across multiple devices, including multiple CPUs, GPUs and distributed server nodes.
* Flexible symbolic manipulation to composite and construction of state-of-the-art deep learning models.

For more details, please refer to the
[documentation](https://dmlc.github.io/MXNet.jl/latest) and [examples](examples).
