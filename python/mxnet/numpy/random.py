    """Return random integers from `low` (inclusive) to `high` (exclusive).

    Return random integers from the "discrete uniform" distribution of
    the specified dtype in the "half-open" interval [`low`, `high`). If
    `high` is None (the default), then results are from [0, `low`).

    Parameters
    ----------
    low : int
        Lowest (signed) integer to be drawn from the distribution (unless
        ``high=None``, in which case this parameter is one above the
        *highest* such integer).
    high : int, optional
        If provided, one above the largest (signed) integer to be drawn
        from the distribution (see above for behavior if ``high=None``).
    size : int or tuple of ints, optional
        Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
        ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
        single value is returned.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        Desired dtype of the result. All dtypes are determined by their
        name, i.e., 'int64', 'int', etc, so byteorder is not available
        and a specific precision may have different C types depending
        on the platform. The default value is 'np.int'.
    ctx : Context, optional
        Device context of output. Default is current context.
    out : ndarray, optional
        The output ndarray (default is `None`).

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray of ints
        `size`-shaped array of random integers from the appropriate
        distribution, or a single such random int if `size` not provided.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.random.randint(2, size=10)
    array([1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0])
    >>> np.random.randint(1, size=10)
    array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])

    array([[4, 0, 2, 1],
        [3, 2, 2, 0]])

    Samples are uniformly distributed over the half-open interval
    ``[low, high)`` (includes low, but excludes high).  In other words,
    any value within the given interval is equally likely to be drawn
    by `uniform`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    low : float, ndarray, optional
        Lower boundary of the output interval.  All values generated will be
        greater than or equal to low.  The default value is 0.
    high : float, ndarray, optional
        Upper boundary of the output interval.  All values generated will be
        less than high.  The default value is 1.0.
    size : int or tuple of ints, optional
        Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
        ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
        a scalar tensor containing a single value is returned if
        ``low`` and ``high`` are both scalars.
    dtype : {'float16', 'float32', 'float64'}, optional
        Data type of output samples. Default is 'float32'
    ctx : Context, optional
        Device context of output. Default is current context.

    Returns
    -------

    Samples are distributed according to a normal distribution parametrized

    Parameters
    ----------

    This function currently does not support ``loc`` and ``scale`` as ndarrays.

def multinomial(n, pvals, size=None, **kwargs):
    """multinomial(n, pvals, size=None)
    Draw samples from a multinomial distribution.
    The multinomial distribution is a multivariate generalisation of the binomial distribution.
    Take an experiment with one of ``p`` possible outcomes. An example of such an experiment is throwing a dice,
    where the outcome can be 1 through 6. Each sample drawn from the distribution represents n such experiments.
    Its values, ``X_i = [X_0, X_1, ..., X_p]``, represent the number of times the outcome was ``i``.
    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        Number of experiments.
    pvals : sequence of floats, length p
        Probabilities of each of the p different outcomes. These should sum to 1.
    size : int or tuple of ints, optional
        Output shape. If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then ``m * n * k`` samples
        are drawn. Default is None, in which case a single value is returned.
    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The drawn samples, of shape size, if that was provided. If not, the shape is ``(N,)``.
        In other words, each entry ``out[i,j,...,:]`` is an N-dimensional value drawn from the distribution.
    Examples
    --------
    Throw a dice 1000 times, and 1000 times again:

    size : int or tuple of ints, optional
